<h1>Intro</h1>

OGV and veOGV are the governance and staked governance tokens developed by Origin Protocol for Origin Dollar.

<h1>OGV and veOGV high level characterisitcs</h1>

Refer to [OUSD docs](https://docs.ousd.com/governance/ogv-staking)

TBD: should we duplicate the content from OUSD docs here?

<h1>Deep dive into linear vs decay voting power</h1>

Refer to [DVF's notes](https://gist.github.com/DanielVF/728326db026c3f95a4e994b286a0a147)

TBD: there is a lot of good content in the notes above. explode it into this section. With maybe nicer graphics (proper legends, nicer pallette, ...).

<h1>Solidity implementation</h1>

Structured into 3 contracts:
 <li>GovernanceToken.sol</li>
 <li>OGVStaking.sol</li>
 <li>RewardsSource.sol</li>

 TODO: add a short description of each contract. Maybe also explain interesting sections of the code?

<h1>Forking OGV and veOGV code for your own project</h1>
It is straight forward to fork the repo and adjust it for the specific needs of your project, or use it as is if you'd like.

Refer to the details [README](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/veogv/blob/main/README.md) for step by step instrcutions.
