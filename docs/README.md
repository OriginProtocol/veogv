This is the code powering the veOGV site.

It uses [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) and [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).

To test on your local, follow the [instructions in the Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
Then run locally from this directory:
```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

TODO:
 - Figure how to have the site use the Origin fonts (Inter and Sailec).
 - Figure how to remove the top header.
